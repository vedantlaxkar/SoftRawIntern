    "# Private Variable in Python\n",
    "In Python, there is no existence of “Private” instance variables that cannot be accessed except inside an object. However, a convention is being followed by most Python code and coders i.e., a name prefixed with an underscore, For e.g. _geek should be treated as a non-public part of the API or any Python code, whether it is a function, a method, or a data member. While going through this we would also try to understand the concept of various forms of trailing underscores, for e.g., for _ in range(10), `__init__(self)`. <br></br>\n",
    "### Mangling and how it works\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, there is something called name mangling, which means that there is limited support for a valid use-case for class-private members basically to avoid name clashes of names with names defined by subclasses. Any identifier of the form `__geek` (at least two leading underscores or at most one trailing underscore) is replaced with `_classname__geek`, where classname is the current class name with a leading underscore(s) stripped. As long as it occurs within the definition of the class, this mangling is done. This is helpful for letting subclasses override methods without breaking intraclass method calls. \n",
