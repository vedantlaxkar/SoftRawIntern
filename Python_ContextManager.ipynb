    "# Python Context Manager\n",
    "\n",
    "A context manager in Python is a way to allocate and release resources precisely when you need to. The most common use case for a context manager is file operations, but it can be used for many other tasks, like managing database connections, threading locks, etc.<br></br>\n",
    "Context managers are implemented using two methods: `__enter__()` and `__exit__()`. The `with` statement in Python is used to wrap the execution of a block of code. The context manager sets up a context for the block of code and takes care of the cleanup after the block of code has been executed, even if an exception occurs.\n",
